Title: Hyperparameter Search for Gradient Boosted Trees
Version: 1.2.0

Description: An implementation of hyperparameter optimization for Gradient
    Boosted Trees on binary classification and regression problems. The current
    version provides two optimization methods: Bayesian optimization and random
    search. Instead of giving the single best model, the final output is an 
    ensemble of Gradient Boosted Trees constructed via the method of ensemble 
    selection.
